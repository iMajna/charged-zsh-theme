Forked from  [robwierzbowski](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/charged-zsh-theme)

A simple zsh prompt with lightning bolt. Use with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).  
Works well with the solarized dark theme.  
Also comes with three levels of CWD, current branch name, and a working or clean symbol.  
But the important part is the lightning bolt.  
Improvements welcome.

#### To install
